            <li>2 tomatoes sliced</li>
            <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>1 red onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 dill pickles thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 tbs tomato sauce to taste</li>
            <li>4 tbs American mustard to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbs Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>4 brioche buns</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Method</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the panko breadcrumbs, parsley, Dijon mustard, beaten egg, salt and pepper and minced beef into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix well using your hands until ingredients are well combined.</li>
            <li>Divide into 4 chunks, then mould into thick round patties.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the patties and refrigerate until needed.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large frypan over a high heat for about 3 minutes, then turn down the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Place your patties gently onto the hot frypan and cook for 4-5 minutes (depending on preference) on one side only.</li>
            <li>Flip your patties, then place 2 pieces of Swiss cheese on top of the cooked side. Cover with a lid for another 4-5 minutes and allow the other side to cook, while the cheese melts. Once cooked, remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Halve brioche buns and place flat sides down on a separate frypan over low heat, until each bun is warm to touch.</li>
            <li>Place one lettuce leaf on the base of each bun.</li>
            <li>Add as many tomato slices as you'd like on top of the lettuce.</li>
            <li>Place each pattie with the melted cheese on top of the tomato slices.</li>
            <li>Add red onion and dill pickles to your liking on top of the patties.</li>
            <li>Squirt tomato sauce and American mustard to your liking over the dill pickles and red onion.</li>
            <li>Place the lid of the bun on top. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
